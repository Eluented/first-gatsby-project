A lot of Millenials rent rather than having their own homes, which means limited outdoor garden options and flats not allowing for pets. Millenials see growing plants as a mental health exercise - it's a break from the hyper connectivity to devices and technology

Habitat acts as a simple aid that assists *'plant parents'* in keeping on top of looking after their plants! Create an account, sign in, add your plant, track how many times you have watered your plant for the day! 

This project utilises a PosgreSQL database, authentication with Bcrypt, Javascript, Express backend.
