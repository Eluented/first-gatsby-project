Have you even planned an event and you cant find the details within the thousands of group chats you have? Or have you encountered difficulties sending direct messages to everyone or creating group chats that are flooded with messages? 

We decided to make an app that you and your friends social calender are available in one place so that you can POST your event and all your friends can view it! 

As an adult everyone has a busy schedule and its difficult to organise an event when everyone has different availabilities, but with uAbout you can view your social calender and organise your events with ease!

Plan events all in one place with uAbout - Add your friends by username, email or first name with the search page! 

#### Search 'rob' and you can see many users to add as an example!
