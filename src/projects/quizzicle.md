### [Click Here to see the live version!](https://quizzicalquiz.netlify.app/) 

Quizzical - an online multiplayer drinking quiz that targets adults who love to drink, and a pub quiz!

To begin, pick a category, the difficulty of the questions and the number of questions you would like to answer. Once you have (picked your username) the game will begin!

### Drinking Rules

If you get a question wrong, drink
If the timer runs out before you answer, drink
The Loser drinks a forfeit, decided by the winner
Winner gets bragging rights, and a pint(winner's choice)
