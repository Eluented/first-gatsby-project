            <p>Hi my name is Onur and I am a recent STEM & futureproof graduate. I am a tenacious individual who strives to improve 1% a day. I have always been a tech savvy person that enjoys aspects of both computer hardware and software which is why I decided to break into the tech industry. I am convinced that technological services will be the forefront of the future, with a plethora of software at anyoneâ€™s fingertips, the opportunities for growth are limitless.</p>
            <p>After graduating from university, I discovered a new-found passion for programming and have made a commitment to actively learn ever since. I then got into a training academy called futureproof to collaborate with others in many group projects and further hone my skills. I graduated from futureproof as a Tech Trainee on the 10th of June and I am now looking for a placement!</p>
